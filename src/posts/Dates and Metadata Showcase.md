This post demonstrates the rendering of published and updated dates. The "Published" date should appear; the "Updated" date should also appear because it differs from the published date.

## Notes

- Some posts may include only `date_published` and omit `date_updated`.
- When `date_updated` equals `date_published`, only the published date should render.
