## About Me

Hey there! I'm **Ben Wyatt**.  I graduated from the **University of Rochester** in 2023 with a BS in **Physics** and BA in **Economics**.

### Academic & Research Experience

During my internship at **Los Alamos National Laboratory**, I conducted data science work in Python for an experiment at the OMEGA‐EP facility.  The project used very short, intense laser pulses to strike thin film targets, producing fast‐moving proton beams.  Our goal was to evaluate how effectively these beams could be used for imaging.  Laser-driven proton radiography can penetrate dense materials and capture rapid changes in high‐pressure, high‐temperature environments, making it valuable for studying fusion experiments and other extreme physics scenarios.

### Current Role

I'm currently at **EY**, working on training large language models. I’m focused on advancing generative AI technologies through data preparation, model fine-tuning, and evaluation.
