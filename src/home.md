## About Me

Hey there! I'm **Ben Wyatt**.  I graduated from the **University of Rochester** in 2023 with a BS in **Physics** and BA in **Economics**.

### Academic & Research Experience

During my internship at **Los Alamos National Laboratory**, I conducted data science work in Python for an experiment at the [OMEGA‐EP laser facility](https://www.lle.rochester.edu/omega-laser-facility-2/6271-2/).  The project used very short, intense laser pulses to strike thin film targets, producing fast‐moving proton beams.  Our goal was to evaluate how effectively these beams could be used for imaging.  Laser-driven proton radiography can penetrate dense materials and capture rapid changes in high‐pressure, high‐temperature environments, making it valuable for studying fusion experiments and other extreme physics scenarios. [Here](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article/32/3/033107/3340167/Characterization-of-laser-accelerated-proton-beams)'s the published paper.

### Current Role

I'm currently at **EY** working as an AI Engineer in New York City.  My team is focused on training LLMs for specific tasks.  I've built end-to-end training pipelines for **Supervised Finetuning**, **Continuous Pretraining**, and **Model Distillation**.  Most of the grunt work is in the data preparation.  I'm also heavily focused on various **Synthetic Data Generation** techniques, especially multi-page long-context documents.

I've also been involved on the infrastructure side, managing the kubernetes deployment on a 16 H200 cluster. 

On the application end, I'm a big proponent of the declarative agent framework [DSPy](https://dspy.ai/).



### Some general thoughts about Generative AI

- Enterprise value unlocks require substantial data transformation work. Garbage in, Garbage out!
- The most important organizational knowledge lives tacitly in employees' brains. For this and [other reasons](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/02/why-i-think-ai-take-off-is-relatively-slow.html), AI adoption will be slow relative to what [some others are saying](https://ai-2027.com/).
- I love the *idea* of GraphRAG but haven't seen an incredible integration yet.
- [Small model agentic RL](https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART) is a very promising innovation and I'm excited to see those tools mature over time.

### Hobbies and Interests

I've recently become obsessed with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note taking and writing.

I play the guitar and listen to music.

I'm really interested in building great knowledge accumulation systems that enable my curiosity.  I like to curate my Substack and RSS feeds. As well as YouTube videos and podcasts.  I've only recently come around to the utility of Twitter.  I see LLMs as a powerful force for this type of curiosity-driven learning.
